## What is my binder?

Teachers have their lesson plans on paper, hand-written out usually. That has to go to a substitute teacher who may or may not be able to read it. It has to last the year through coffee and grading papers. 

In schools now, teachers give kids handouts or write schedules, assignments on a board. Ideally, kids then place the handout in a binder for that subject or or copy down the words from the board into a binder for assignments or a school planner. Then, the parents can obtain this information from a binder and pass it on to grandparents or the divorced parent for concerts or sporting activities. However, it does not always work that way. Kids don't write down the information or they do, but don't place it somewhere safe. Handouts get placed somewhere on the table, then under mail. Concerts are forgotten. After school activities are canceled, kids end up waiting at school because a parent forgot it was canceled that day. 

Life is hectic and as adults, as parents we miss the school days, we miss when we were young and we think a child's life is simpler, and we don't want to let them grow up so even as they enter college we tend to think their life is easier than ours. And as a parent, we want their life to be easier than ours. However; a students life is just a complicated now with extracurricular activities, increasing educational standards, jobs (for the older students), finances for the college student, families for the adult college student. 

Companies use project management tools, individuals use various tracking programs from email, to a myriad of productive apps (todoist, any.do, trello) and any of those could work for schools; but none are designed and geared towards scheduling life around school.

MyBinder is a web application built with teachers, students and parents in mind. Organizations are schools and school districts, users are teachers, students, parents or administrators. Teachers can plan their classes with quizzes, tests, and assignments, students can add information that does not fit into a class they are a part of or add a class when a teacher is not using the application and parents can view all the important information for their child. With the information in the app, a student will receive a notification that a test is in two days, and then in one day, hopefully eliminated that panic when the student shows up and hears everyone talking about the test they forgot. Parents will have more of opportunity to make scheduling arrangements for the orchestra concert to support their child. Teachers will be able to print their lesson plans from the web application and hand out codes for their students to join. Once students join a teacher created class, they can have discussions on assignments, tests, quizzes and the class. In addition, once a student has an account they will have a digital record of their educational track and extracurricular participation. Just because the class is over doesn't mean that the information for that class is gone, just archived under the year.
